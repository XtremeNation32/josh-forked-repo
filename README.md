Welcome to my structured HTML5 webpage created for the Week 2 Lab assignment. This page demonstrates the use of modern semantic HTML elements such as <header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <article>, <aside>, and <footer>. The purpose of this webpage is to showcase how HTML5 allows for cleaner, more meaningful code that improves both accessibility and search engine optimization. Within this page, youâ€™ll find a navigation menu for easy access to different sections, a news article highlighting HTML5 updates, and a fully functional contact form for user interaction. An aside section provides quick links to related web development resources. The layout is designed to be user-friendly and organized, ensuring content is easy to find and understand. This exercise also helps reinforce the importance of using proper structure and elements when developing professional, standards-compliant websites. Thank you for visiting, and feel free to reach out through the contact form below!
